# Part 6 - Principles of coding interviews

- We'll get to know 80% of the most common topics and ideas used in interview problems
- Learn problem-solving strategies so we can figure out 80% of questions on your own

### The principles and the catalog

#### Principles

- Study plan: how to practice with the book
- Universal rubric: how you're evaluated by interviewers
- Interview checklist: breaking down each step you should take in a coding interview
- Big-O analysis: In-depth coverage of the "language" of technical interviews
- Problem-solving strategies: boundary thinking, trigger thinking, and problem-solving boosters

#### Catalog

DSA

- Tier 1: essential topics, from sets & maps to trees and graphs
- Tier 2: intermediate topics like heaps, sliding windows, and prefix sums
- Tier 3: Nice topics

### Topics, Recipes, and Reusable ideas

- Topic: a chapter from the catalog, like binary search
- Reusable idea: a coding idea that can be typically used across problems (and even topics)
- Coding recipe: pseudo-code template related to a specific topic that can be used as building block to solve similar problems with small tweaks

> Personal note: Since this part is quite big, with big chapters, I found better to break them apart
