Hi {First Name},

I’ve read your work on {some details about their writing}, and I {insert your thoughts on the work}.

{If you can make the connection between their work and yours, talk about something similar you’ve been working on.}

{If you cannot, ask them a specific, thoughtful question about your work. Don’t worry about making it “the perfect question” like you might when you attend a talk and want to sound smart. Any earnest question will do. You don’t have to use this as a chance to show off!}

{Finally, close with a sentence or two about you, if you have some social proof or impressive accomplishments you can share.}

Would you be up for a quick chat this week or next?

Best,

{Your name}

{Insert 1-2 useful links about you. If you have a personal site, that’s great. If not, a LinkedIn will do.}
