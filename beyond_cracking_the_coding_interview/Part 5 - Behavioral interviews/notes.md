# Part 5 - Behavioral Interviews

## Chapter 15 - When and how they matter

- The bar is rising for behavioral interviews
- They are used for leveling
  - In tough hiring climates, they can make the difference

### What goes wrong

1. Not using START method
2. Insufficient detail
3. Unprepared / too long answer
4. Lack of conciseness
5. Not answering interviewer's questions
6. Not articulating lessons learned
7. Not showing personal responsibility, humility, empathy

## Chapter 16 - What to say

"Tell me about a challenging project you have tackled"

- This should be on the tip of your tongue

If you don't know the answer to the question above:

1. You say something, but had more challenging situations but didn't think of them.
   This is fault in **preparation**
2. You thought of these other challenges, but didn't select the most relevant one. T
   This is fault in **selecting** and possibly **leveling**
3. You picked a great challenge, but failed to send a compelling message about what was truly important
   This is fault in **signal**
4. You said the right stuff, but the story was disorganized
   This is fault in **communication**

### Signal

- Even though you might answer the question, it can feel flat, without storytelling
- The thing is, the mission isn't necessarily to describe (technically the situation), but to understand "how smart/creative/persistent/problem-solver" you are by walking through the challenge

#### What is signal?

- It's not WHAT happened, but WHO you are
- What does this story should about you?
- Your answers should demonstrate something about you. At the end of each story, they should be felling:
  > "wow, he is a [something good] kind of person"

#### Matching questions to signals

- In open-ended questions, thye are typically looking for a (set of) signal(s)
- Which signals are they trying to identify in the following questions?

1. Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a difficult team member. How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?

- empathy, collaboration, problem-solving, communication, conflict management, and ability to tailor communication or approach

2. Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a decision made by your manager or team. How did you handle the situation?

- team-player, problem-solving, communication, listening-skills, analytical thinking, emotional intelligence

Tell me about a time when you...

3. ...were working on a project that was behind schedule

- prioritization, organization, capacity to deliver, time management

4. ...made a mistake

- humbleness, ability to admit your mistakes, learning with experience, modesty, self-awareness, maturity

5. ...had to balance the needs of multiple stakeholders

- communication, prioritization, capacity to deliver

6. ...influenced an individual or team

- leadership, problem-solving, communication, capacity to adjust communiation and approach

7. ...identified a performance issue in code

- observation, analytical thinking, problem-solving, technical knowledge

#### Signal in open-ended questions

Good signals to hit:

1. Being smart / creative
2. Being persistent
3. Being technically knowledgeable
4. Can lead / has accomplished things at the level of this role

Every company wants an engineer who...

- is smart
- works hard
- knows a lot
- can lead / work at the appropriate level

### Picking the right projects

- They want to know your skills at:
  - the technical level
  - interpersonal level

#### What makes a good project?

1. Recency and familiarity
   - Recently enough and at enough depth
2. Large contribution
3. Part of a team
   - At more senior levels, this morphs into working well with several other teams or leading several teams
4. Difficult, open-ended task
   - Can you thrive in ambiguous circumstances?
   - The more uncertainty, the better, as long as you can describe how you tamed the chaos
5. Successes and failures
   - Failures: mention what you learned and how you made it right
6. Signal sending stories
   - What attributes does this story tell about you?
   - Often related to the company's values
   - Look up the company's values and identify stories that match them
7. Appropriate scope for the level you're targeting
   - Show them you're already doing the job
   - Thinking at the level of the role you're applying for
8. High visibility, if possible
   - Even though this is important, it shouldn't come at the cost of the other aspects
   - Meaning, if you played a obscure role at some huge project, it's not as important as a meaningful role in something smaller

> Anything, just ask: "I have a project in mind that demonstrates X and another that demonstrates Y. Which one would you rather hear about?"

- If you're not sure about what your interviewer is looking for, just ask
- If you've shown ownership and large contribution (was given minimal direction and didn't have many people to ask), make sure you mention this out

### Generating your stories

#### Story generation

- Have at least 3 technical projects and 5 stores that you're comfortable to go in depth

##### Strategy 1: Category-based generation

Most behavioral questions can be grouped into a few basic categories:

1. Accomplishments & challenges
   - What are you most proud of?
   - Where did you hit obstacles and how did you overcome them?
2. Leadership, influence & decision-making
   - How did you drive alignment on your team and across teams?
   - What decisions did you make, and how did you influence people to agree?
   - When have you proposed a change or something new?
3. Conflicts & collaboration
   - When have you disagreed with teammates?
   - Are there other conflicts you have faced and how did you address these?
4. Enjoyment & learning
   - What did you like doing?
   - What did you learn (technologies, approaches)?
5. Mistakes & failure
   - What mistakes did you make?
   - When have you struggled, or even failed?

##### Strategy 2: Signal-based generation (strengths, weaknesses, and values)

- Your strengths
  - What are you really good at?
  - How would people describe you?
  - Demonstrate them through technical stories
- Your weaknesses
  - These stories should lead to mistakes and failures and ideally redemption
  - Interviewers feel candidates who haven't made big mistakes haven't had big responsibilities
    - or that the candidate isn't sincere
    - story about a mistake + actual personal weakness + growth (acknowledgement of the weakness + what you learned and how you've improved) = powerful
- The company's values

### Leveling

- Mistakes that people make in behavioral interviews that cause them to get down-leveled

1. Not showing conflict resolution skills/inability to work with difficult people
2. Not matching stores/project scope to seniority level
3. Not talking about process-level improvements
4. Not enough examples given of mentorship
5. Not thinking about long-term impact of their choices/solutions
6. Not good at delegating
7. Not talking about how thye are/would be a force multiplier

Your stories should include:

- Suggesting/making architectural changes/contribution to the design of the project
- Capacity to deliver within time/requirements constraint
- Mentoring your peers
- Proactively communicating with non-engineering members
  - product managers
  - salespeople
  - other stakeholders

### Assess your project

- When applying to Mid-to-senior role, choosing the correct project matters much more
- Your score should be between 5-7

- Can you clearly articulate the impact that you made, preferable with numbers? (+1 point)
  - Did the project have well-defined metrics? (+1 point)
    - Did you come up with the metrics? (+1 point)
- Did you make any meaningful architectural decisions as part of this project? (+1 point)
- Did you advocate for putting in some kind of process or some changes that made future projects better? (+1 point)
  - Were you able to actually implement the said project? (+1 point)
- Do you remember this project in enough detail, to the point where you'd be comfortable answering in depth if your interviewer asks about what you would have done if some constraints were different? (+1 point)

## Chapter 17 - How to say it

- Behavioral interviews are about
  - your experiences
  - your skills
  - how well you communicate
    - can you explain complex ideas clearly?
    - can you tell a compelling story?
    - communication is the bridge between your experience and your interviewer's understanding
