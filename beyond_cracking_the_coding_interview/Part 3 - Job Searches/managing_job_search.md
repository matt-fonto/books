### What to Say 1 - Postponing

Hey [name], I’m really excited about interviewing at [company name]. Unfortunately, if I’m honest, I haven’t had a chance to practice as much as I’d like. I know how hard and competitive these interviews are, and I want to put my best foot forward. I think I’ll realistically need a couple of months to prepare. How about we schedule my interview for [date]?

### What to Say 2 - Speeding Up

[If you need to speed up an early-stage startup]

At the moment, I’m wrapping up final interviews at a few companies and expect to make a decision in the next 2 weeks. Would it be possible to expedite the process? I’m really excited about {Company name} and want to make sure I don’t miss out on the chance to work with you all.

Note: We don’t mention specific companies where you’re interviewing, regardless of who they are. For early stage startups, it’s generally not useful, as we discussed above. You also don’t need to be super specific in your request to expedite—early stage startups are nimble and should be able to adjust their schedule and figure it out.

[If you need to speed up a late-stage startup or a large company]

At the moment, I’m wrapping up onsites at {If you have FAANG or competitors offers, list them here. Otherwise just say “a few companies”} and expect to make a decision in the next 2 weeks. [If you’re pre-phone screen] Would it be possible to schedule my technical phone screen as soon as possible or perhaps go straight to onsite? Alternatively, maybe we can schedule the phone screen and tentatively schedule the onsite in parallel and then cancel if the phone screen doesn’t go well? [If you’re post-phone screen] Would it be possible to schedule my final interview rounds as soon as possible? I’m really excited about {Company name} and want to make sure I don’t miss out on the chance to work with you all.

### What to Say 3 - Slowing Down Before the Onsite

[At a startup]

I would really appreciate it if we could postpone the onsite by a few weeks. I would like a bit more time to prepare. As you can imagine, I'm taking this opportunity very seriously and want to do everything I can to maximize my chances. If doing so would hurt my chances of getting hired because you have limited headcount right now, please let me know, and I'll think it through carefully.

[At a large company (applying for a specific team)]

I would really appreciate it if we could postpone the onsite by a few weeks. I would like a bit more time to prepare. As you can imagine, I'm taking this opportunity very seriously and want to do everything I can to maximize my chances. If doing so would hurt my chances of ending up on {TEAM}, let me know, and I'll think it through carefully. If there's a chance that I can end up on a different team, please let me know (this would not be my preference, as I'm very excited about this team; just trying to think through my options).

[Large company (centralized/has team matching)]

### What to Say 4 - Slowing Down After the Onsite

[At a startup]

I’m currently wrapping up interviews with a few other companies. As you can imagine, this is a decision I’m not taking lightly, and I’d like to have as much information as possible. I expect to collect offers by {DATE} and make a decision by {DATE}. I promise not to accept any offers without discussing them with you.
