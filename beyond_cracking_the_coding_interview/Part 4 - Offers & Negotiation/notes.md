# Part 4 - Offers and negotiation

- Offers usually consist of four components: base salary, equity, signing bonus, and performance bonus
- All of this together is the TC, Total Compensation

## Chapter 10: Components of the offer

### Base salary

- One of the hardest parts to negotiate
- Increases being rarely more than 10-20%
- Studies have shown that raises add up to much less cash than switching jobs every few years

### Equity

- Equity most commonly comes as either stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs)

## Chapter 11: The What & Why of Negotiation

- The importance of negotiating just grows with time
- Learn how to do it. Don't avoid it

### You should always negotiate. Get used to it early in your career, while the stakes are low

- Negotiating is unlikely to jeopardize your job offer
- It's a way to get more money without much more effort than simply valuing yourself
- Companies rarely give their best possible offer right away

It's about preparation and leverage:

- Do the work to make sure you have multiple offers
- Ensure your offers come at the same time (air control)
- Don't tip your hand too early
- Don't share anything with recruiters until you're ready to negotiate
- Don't negotiate before you're ready

## Chapter 12: Pre-offer negotiation mistakes

Mistakes to avoid:

### Revealing information too early

- Do not share information about (money & other interviews):

  - Salary history
  - Comp expectation
    - Recruiters ask about comp expectation so they can use it against you in later negotiations
    - Saying a number puts a ceiling in your offer
  - Where else you're interviewing
  - How far along in the process you're with other companies
    - This can either:
      - backoff in smaller companies
      - you get lowballed if they sense limited options
  - Revealing precocious information, you can weaken your position

    - The one exception to revealing information is that sometimes it can be helpful to share rough estimate for when you'll be collecting offers, if you expect that time will be far in the future

  - "I don't have to leave my job, so my currenct job is leverage", that's not true though
  - Almost every candidate you're competing with will be currently employed
  - Revealing information before you know what hand you've been dealt, it can only hurt you

```txt
      "I've just started interviewing. I expect to get through all my interviews and onsites in the next 6 weeks and start collecting offers roughly 2 months from now. Does that timeline work for you?"
```

### Negotiating before you're ready

"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes"

- Think of it like a hand of cards. At the beginning, you have no idea what you're going to draw
- The longer you wait to negotiate, assuming you've timed things correctly, the more information you have
- Negotiate after having enough information. Negotiate knowing what else is on the table
- Ideally, you wait until all your offers come in, and then you negotiate once, at the end
  - It's best to ask any given company to raise their offer just once
- By starting to negotiate, you accelerated their timeline
- It's much easier to slow things down, than to walk things back

### Enter "passing information gathering" mode - instead of talking, listen

- Until you're ready to negotiate, trun on the "passing information gathering" mode

  - Listen rather than talk

- steps:
  - Express genuine enthusiasm
    - company
    - interview process
  - Use email as much as possible with recruiters (avoid phone and definitely not text)
    - Leave your phone number off your resume
    - During first conversation, tell recruiter you prefer email
      "do not disturb" during work hours and don't want to miss anything important from them
      - If they call or text, responde after a few hours via email and remind them that email is best
        - Phone calls and texts are disruptive, and they pressure you into quick, often poor responses
- Don't feel pressure to answer questions directly
  - You don't need to react to what recruiters tell you, nor need to answer their questions

#### Why you should get comfortable with not answering recruiter questions

- You can safely ignore most of the questions that come your way
- Be able to address their worry **without revealing more info than necessary**
  - **By addressing the worry, you don't need to say anything else**

### Exactly what to say to recruiters at the beginning of the process

All snippets end with: **I promise not to accept other offers until I have a change to discuss them with you**

See: `what_to_say_recruiters_beginning_process.md`

#### Comp expectation

- The goal is to avoid locking yourself into a number too early while keeping the conversation open

#### Timeline

- They will often ask you how far along you're with other companies, and where you're interviewing
- Should you be vague or specific?

  - Ask them during the call how long the process takes on average
    - It will help you how you approach the timeline question

- Use this [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ar8aGAlLzR4XFqBYRomD4agHs8HLP-4R4Uq1AiCPdas/edit#gid=0) to help you estimate how long the process will take at each of the companies

- If the company you're talking to is among the slowest, don't reveal your timeline
  - Slower companies: it doesn't serve you to reveal timeline because there's nothing the recruiter can do to speed up the process
    - Except try to apply high-pressure tactics to make you accept an offer
- If they are faster than a few of the companies you're talking to, you should reveal your timeline
  - Fast-moving companies: good to manage expectations upfront that it may take you a bit longer to get to a decision

### Multiple offers: The best way to get more money

- Leverage is important
- Try to get an offer `_____` you do technical screen
  - good market: 1/4 companies
  - rough market: 1/6 companies

#### Having a job isn't leverage

- Most engineers who are actively interviewing are still employed
  - Whem almost everyone else has something, it's not considered leverage

## Chapter 13: Getting the offer: Exactly what to say

- Up until negotiation stage, be single-mindedly air traffic controlling
- Create options and leverage
- Once you have multiple options, decide where you want to go
- Even though the recruiter wants you to response immediately, you should not
  - How to buy time?
    - You definitely don't want to negotiate over the phone, on the spot

See: `what_to_say_getting_offer.md`

- Exploring offers are a high-pressure tactic aimed at preventing you from exploring elsewhere by imposing tight deadlines

## Chapter 14: How to negotiate

### How to negotiate if you don't have multiple offers

- If you're actively interviewing, play companies off each other
  - Looming onsite is already enough to get a small increase in compensation
  - Especially effective if interviewing for a competitor of your target company

#### If you this is your only offer and you have no other interviews

- You should try not to be in this position
- It's quite hard to negotiate without leverage
- What to do?

1. Lie about other offers

- avoid this as much as possible

2. Lie about interviews

- as point 1, avoid it
  "I'm wrapping up a few onsites and have several phone screens coming up"

3. Bring up existing compensation

4. Try to negotiate without bringing up other companies

"I'm close to making a decision. Is there any possibility we could attach a signing bonues to my offer? If so, I'd be willing to sign immediately"

### How to negotiate if you have multiple offers

#### Boom markets: The reverse used car salesman

- Which company would be your first choice if money was out of the table
- This is the moment, we start showing our cards
- You can negotiate your:
  - Equity
    - 50%-100% increase
    - 1.5x of your best competing offer
  - Signing bonus
    - Startup seed stage: "meaningful signing bonus"
    - Startup beyond seed stage: 15% of your base salary
    - Large company: 25% of base salary
  - Salary
    - The trickier for employeers to grant
    - Don't over index on the salary ranges you see published online
    - Bands are at maximum polite suggestions
- By demanding 3, you'll likely get 2
- Whatever you ask for, the counterpart will meet you halfway
  - "Law of midpoints"

#### Down markets: The laddder

- In a down market, recruiters become conservative and not that willing to match much of your wants
- It takes much more work to get results
- Pick your first choice
- Make 2 rankings:

  - Excitement about the company/role
  - Initial offer size

- Once you have these 2 lists, glom them together

  - The goal is to get comp from highest to lowest while still taking into account excitement

- Then, you start negotiating from the bottom upwards and see what you can get

See: `closing_out.md`

- While you wait for offers of the bottom, you can start negotiating with the top

#### Offer deadlines and how negotiation resets the clock

- Every time you start to negotiate, the clock resets
- Once the ball is in their court, time is on your side

#### Negotiating with founders vs. recruiters

- If negotiating with a founder, things get different
- For founders, everything is personal

  - The company is their baby

- So, what to do?
  - When founders ask you where you're interviewing, soften the recommended copy
  - Say that you understand startups can't pay the same thing as FAANG
  - You may be able to negotiate much more equity than cash
