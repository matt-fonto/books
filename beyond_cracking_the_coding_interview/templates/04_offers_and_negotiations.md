# Part 4 - Offers and negotiation

- Offers usually consist of four components: base salary, equity, signing bonus, and performance bonus
- All of this together is the TC, Total Compensation

## Chapter 10: Components of the offer

### Base salary

- One of the hardest parts to negotiate
- Increases being rarely more than 10-20%
- Studies have shown that raises add up to much less cash than switching jobs every few years

### Equity

- Equity most commonly comes as either stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs)

## Chapter 11: The What & Why of Negotiation

- The importance of negotiating just grows with time
- Learn how to do it. Don't avoid it

### You should always negotiate. Get used to it early in your career, while the stakes are low

- Negotiating is unlikely to jeopardize your job offer
- It's a way to get more money without much more effort than simply valuing yourself
- Companies rarely give their best possible offer right away

It's about preparation and leverage:

- Do the work to make sure you have multiple offers
- Ensure your offers come at the same time (air control)
- Don't tip your hand too early
- Don't share anything with recruiters until you're ready to negotiate
- Don't negotiate before you're ready

## Chapter 12: Pre-offer negotiation mistakes

Mistakes to avoid:

- Revealing information too early
  - Do not share information about:
    - Salary history
    - Comp expectation
    - Where else you're interviewing
    - How far along in the process you're with other companies
- Negotiating before you're ready
