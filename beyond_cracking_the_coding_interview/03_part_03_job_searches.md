# Part 3 - Job searches, from start to finish

## Chapter 6 - Resumes

- Recruiters don't spend too long reviewing your resume
- Optmize, but don't overoptimize it

### What recruiters look at

They are most likely to contact you if:

- you look good on paper (top-tier companies/schools)
- you belong to a group that's underrepresented in tech
- to some extent, if you have niche skills

---

- Recruiters do look at resumes, spending around 30 seconds reviewing them
- They aren't reading the details

--

### Adequate resume

- Make it easy to skim

1. Use a templae
2. Keep it to one or two pages
3. Write up your experience. Clear, concise bullets
4. Add your skills, education, and other sections
5. Proofread

- Usually 1 page is better than 2

  - It allows important stuff to jump out

- What are the top few things that would make a recruiter say "Yes, I want to interview you"

  - Design your resume around those items
  - It should in 30-seconds be easily spotted why

- Clear, concise bulltets

  - Where possible, use metrics
  - Bullets: 1-2 lines

- If you have a good GPA, why not put it?

### Skills

- List languages in proficiency order
- Drop a language if neither of the following is true
  - Worked with it in depth in the last 3 years
  - Can code a typical interview question with it, with only minor syntax errors

### Projects

- At most 3

## Chapter 7 - Getting in the door

- Effective recruiting channels, ranked from most to least effective

  - Warm referrals
  - In-house recruiters contact you
  - Apply online
  - Cold outreach to hiring managers: controllable and effective

- Ineffective recruiting channels
  - Cold outreach to recruiters
  - Cold referrals
  - Agency recruiters contact you

### In your control and useful

- Cold outreach to hiring managers (done right)
- Apply online
  - It's predictable, but not the most effective
- Cold outreach to hiring managers

- Cold outreach to recruiters doesn't work
- Recruiters will play it safe, they can't have a too risky candidate
- The recruiting system is wired to reward (them), for the tip of the tunnel, not how many are hired

### What a brand candidate looks like to recruiters

- Senior engineer
- Went to a top school
- Worked at a top company

### Reach out to hiring managers instead

- Hiring managers are judged on how quickly and effectively they're able to build stuff and are incentivized to grow headcount
- At smaller companies, also target VP and directors

### Recommended practical approach

- Teach your job search as a sales funnel
- Do the reps, brute force it

- Buy a month or two of LinkedIn sales navigator
- Get an account with an email discovery tool like RocketReach
- Get Streak, which lets dynamic typing for Gmail

  - Create a template email, with variables

#### Steps

1. Figure out which companies you're interested in

- Dev tools
- Open source
- Engineers you follow

2. Create target list

- Once you have the list, find hiring managers at those companies (founders, directors, VPs)
- Once the list is done, add them to a spreadsheet and something that can connect you

> If you don't come from a traditional background, look for startups, especially ones where the founder also doesn't have a traditional background

- Once the list of LinkedIn URLs is done, use a tool like RocketReach to look up their emails

  - Why not linkedin? Managers don't usually spend much time on LinkedIn, differently from recruiters
  - However, they spend a good amount of time on their email
  - Contact them through their work email address, preferably. But it's also fine personal.

- Outreach emails aren't a job application

  - Connect with a human being. Don't be a weirdo
  - Not super focused on a specific position or team

- Succint, personalized emails
  - Personalized + short
  - Don't open the email with how you found them
  - Be informal
  - Don't get their gender wrong
  - Write something that's personal. If you haven't invested the time, why should they?
  - No buzzword soup
  - Include a link to LinkedIn or personal website
    - Don't include your CV though, it's presemptuous
  - Make a no-brainer why you are the one
    1. Common ground
    - Referece something they care about, then show how you can contribute to it
    - Reference a project they worked on
      - Reference some work you've done
      - Ask a thoughtful question about theirs
    - Reference a controversial pov that they hold and affirm it in an authentic way
    - In the absence of something technical, it's okay to reference something non-technical
    2. Proof that you're worth the time
    - Accomplishments: what have you built or created?
      - What have you done that it's unique?
    - Social proof
    3. Strong CTA
    - Extend a job interview
    - Start a conversation

### Cold outreach templates

- These emails are much more effective than throwing your resume into the black hole of online portals

[see cold_outreach.md on templates]

## Chapter 8 - Mechanics of the interview process

- Ask about the interview process
  - Topics
  - Format
  - What to expect
  - How you'll be evaluated

### Steps

#### 1. Source/apply (candiate review)

- Passthrough rate around 10%

#### 2. Recruiter call

- Pass rate 75%
- Ask the recruiter before the call, the specific requirements the role has
  - Don't assume job descriptions are accurate
  - Some matter, some don't. They are at most a laundry list of requirements
- What are the non-negotiables for this role?

  - Tell them you've read the job description, but just want to be sure

- Questions to ask them

```
[If it's clear what the non-negotiables are]
I've taken a close look at the job description, and I'm very excited for our call.


[If it's not clear]
- From what I can tell from the job description, the non-negotiable requirements are [insert bullet list here]. I just wanted to confirm that those are indeed correct

Ahead of the call, would you mind sharing the non-negotiable requirements for this position?

I want to make sure I'm prepared to speak to how I meet those requirements and to make the best use of our time together
```

- Hiring managers want somebody that's smart and gets shit done
- If you don't have some requirements... the best thing is that you can do is to show you possess many of the same traits as people who do

##### Mistake to avoid

- Don't reveal your compensation...
  - history
  - expectation
- Don't reveal where else you're interviewing and where you're in the process

##### Questions to ask

- What are the steps of the rest of the process?
- How long does it take to get through the process, on average?
- What to expect during the technical phone screen
  - Types of questions: DSA or practical?
  - Tooling
- Components of the onsite
- What are the reasons most candidates fail the tehnical and the onsite?
- Is there something I should've asked, but missed?

#### 3. Technical interview

- 25% of candidates pass through this
- The objective is just to cut people who aren't likely to pass the onsite
- Does asking questions at the end matter?

  - 50% of interviews don't care
  - 25% expect you to ask somethign
  - 25% want to see curiosity

- Therefore, prepare some basic questions about the company, role, team, or technology

#### 4. Onsite

- They shoot for a 33% to 50% approval at this stage, since for the company it's also expensive

##### Format

1. Coding: 1-3 rounds
2. System design: 1-2 rounds. More common if you have some years of experience
3. Behavioral: 1-2 rounds

##### What to avoid

- Asking about work/life balance verbatim
  - Instead:
    - What a typical day looks like
    - How the team productivity happens
- Questions that should go to HR
  - Ask about the work, not the vacations
- Silly time fillers or personal questions

##### Good questions from candidates

- Just ask some stuff about the company and tech
- Not asking anything sounds as indifference

##### Team Caliber/Culture

- What are cool/exciting/fulfilling/technically complex project you've worked on here so far?
- What made you choose this company first of all?

##### Engineering

- What does your typical day look like?
- What is your stack?
- How would you describe the engineering philosophy here?
- What is the ratio of working on new stuff vs. iterating on existing stuff?
- What is the most costly technical decision made early on that the company is still living with now?

##### Product voice/visibility into the business side

- What are cool things that were last release? Where did it come from?
- What makes this company unique compared with other players?

##### Entrepreneurship

- How many former employees have gone on to found startups?

## Chapter 9 - Managing your job search

- Timing is important
- "Air traffic" control is important, it allows you to control the offers you have and how many choices

[Job seach worksheet](https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/part-iii-job-searches/managing-your-job-search#worksheet-1)

#### Should you use other companies to experiment?

- Meaning, applying for a job you're not much in the mood to do, just to test how it goes
- The authors don't think this is the best way to invest your time
  - Companies, depending on the size, having different hiring bars
  - Throwaway interviews...
    - are different from the real thing
    - don't give you feedback
    - might accidentally become real

> Candidates usually underestimate their performance 3x more often than they overestimate

- But, if you still decide to do them..
  - Pick companies whose interview styles are as close as possible to your target company
  - Choose companies with comparable bars to your target companies
  - Try to get detailed feedback

> "Based on my performance in this interview, is there anything I should study up on ahead of my futurue interviews? Anything you can share would be awesome. I won't argue the point and will just take some notes"

### How to balanace timing for practice vs. outreach

- One of the hardest things is balancing outreach to companies with interview prep

  - How much personal runway do you have, and how much time can you dedicate to interview prep?

### Tips

- Don't wait until you feel ready to outreach. Start with this. It can drag on for months
  - Thus, giving you enough time to study after you find your rhythm
- If you don't hear back from companies after a month or two, review your messages and target list
- Once you're comfortable with DSA, simulate as much as possible interview scenarios
  - Time yourself
  - Practice walking through your thought process
- Add mock interviews with another person once you get your footing
  - Mock interviews weekly
  - 10+ mock interviews before onsite is a good goal
- If possible, try to divide outreach and interview prep. Otherwise, know that it'll be an uphill battle
- If still working, take your time, but once you start doing it, limit it to 3 months, otherwise it can become tiring
- Don't underestimate the tool of job searching
  - The authors strongly advise against planning for more than 3 months of job searching

### Postponing interviews if you're not ready

> Algorithmic interviews determines whether you get an offer, and system design determines how you're leveled

- Recruiters don't really care when you interview
- If interviewing at large companies, most engineering roles will be evergreen

  - If interviewing for a small one, check if postponing might cause you to loose the offer

- It's okay to say you need some time to prepare
  - However, schedule the interview for a few months, don't leave it open
- Better to postpone than fail

### Air traffic control: Stalling and speeding up

#### Speeding up

- In some situations, you want the company to expedite your interview
- When doing so, it's better to talk about wrapping up on sites rather then mentioning offers
  - Galvanize them without scaring them off
  - FAANG-adjacent companies like Stripe don't want to lose candidates to FAANG, and planting the seed it's a good way to mobilize them
- If interviewing at earlier stage startup, DO NOT use your FAANG onsites as leverage
