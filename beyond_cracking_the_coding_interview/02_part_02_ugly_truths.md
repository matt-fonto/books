# Part 1 - hello world

## Chapter 0

- Cover important non-technical topics
  - Resumes
  - Negotiation
  - Job search

# Part II - Ugly truths & Hidden Realities

## Chapter 0 - Why job searches suck

- Job searches are non-deterministic, and neither are the interview outcomes
- No feedback loop
- The content of your resume can be eclipsed by the brands in it
- To get in the door, you very likely need to know someone
- Technical interviews are not that representative of the actual engineering work you do every day

## Chapter 1 - A brief history of technical interviews

- It was needed a method to quickly and scalably assess high volumes of candidates for potential
- Over time, companies switched from puzzles to algorithmic questions
  - More relevant to the field, but still focused on problem-solving skills

## Chapter 2 - What's broken about coding interviews

- It's not uncommon that senior engineer perform worse in this than juniors, due to the fact it's been a while since they were in touch with DSA
- Experienced engineers perform the worst of all groups
- On average, it takes five mock interviews to start passing them
- Bad questions
  - Too academic, obscure
  - Bad questions
  - Too much memorization
- You're more likely to pass interviews when you've seen the question before

  - 65% against 49%
  - 33% more likely to pass

- In this process, you're meant to discuss approaches and ask questions, so that it can be seen if...

  - ...you're the type of person who can adapt and learn fast
  - ...can work well with others

- Non-deterministic outcome

  - 25% of people are consistent, the others all over the place
  - 64% of the people who scored at least one 4 have also at least one 1 or one 2
  - There's some significant random factor
    - experience
    - qualifications
      don't fully explain it

- Bucketed scoring
  - strong no-hire, no-hire, hire, strong hire
  - risk-averse scoring

## Chapter 3 - What recruiters won't tell you

> Show me the incentives, and I'll show you the outcome. Charlie Munger

- Recruiters aren't your friend, nor do they work for you
- Recruiter's bonus structure might reward certain behaviors, some of which run counter to the candidates' interest

### 3rd Party recruiters

- Realize, you're not the customer, the employer is
- They want to get the deal done, not get you the best deal
- A recruiter gets 8%-25% of a candidate's base salary
  - This goes to the whole agency, not the individual recruiter
- They're evaluated on the number of hires they make

Tips

- Don't tell them anything about your job search
- Don't share your compensation history/expectations
- Always deal directly with the companies they introduce you to, once you establish a point of contact there
- Assume that anything you tell them is going to get back toevery company you're working with
- Use email, not text/call. You're level the playing field

### In house recruiters

- They might get a bonus if they can negotiate you down

- Never assume that the recruiter you're talking with now will still be there some months down the line

## Chapter 4 - What interviewers won't tell you
