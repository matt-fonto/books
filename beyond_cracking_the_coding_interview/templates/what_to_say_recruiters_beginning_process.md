### Questions about comp expectation

[For questions about comp expectations]

At this point, I don’t feel equipped to throw out a number because I’d like to find out more about the opportunity first—right now, I simply don’t have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.

If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you.

I’m at various stages with a number of different companies, but based on what you told me, it sounds like there won’t be any timing challenges. I promise to keep you posted if anything comes up.
