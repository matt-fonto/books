### What to Say 1 - The Reverse Used Car Salesman

{I have 5 offers, including ones from Company X and Company Y/I have several strong offers} and am wrapping up the process with {Company M and Company Z/a few more}, but I’m really excited about this opportunity and will drop my other stuff and sign immediately if you can do the following:

- Increase the base to X
- Increase equity to Y
- Add a $Z signing bonus

Thank you so much, and I look forward to hearing from you. Hopefully, we’ll be working together soon!

### What to Say 2 - The Ladder First Email

Thank you so much for your offer and for all your help with this process so far. I’m excited about this opportunity, but I have several other strong offers in hand, from a mix of startups and larger companies. I know you can’t match FAANG salaries in cash, and I’m not expecting it (there are plenty of great reasons to choose startups over FAANGs), but it’d be great to see a significant increase in both the cash and the equity component, as well as a meaningful signing bonus.

Can you please let me know what’s possible? I’d appreciate it very much.

### What to Say 3 - The Ladder Second Email

As I mentioned, I have offers from a mix of startups and large companies. Most base salaries are around $200k, and I have a few strong signing bonuses as well. Equity is in the $400k-$500k range.

### What to Say 4 - The Ladder Third Email

Thank you so much for your offer and for all your help with this process so far. I’m excited about this opportunity, but I have several other strong offers in hand, from a mix of startups and larger companies, including Stripe and Google. I know that you likely can’t match FAANG salaries in cash, and I’m not expecting it, but it’d be great to see a significant increase in both the base salary and the signing bonus.

### What to Say 5 - The Ladder Fourth Email

Thank you so much for your offer and for all your help with this process so far. I’m excited about this opportunity, but I have several very strong offers in hand, including one from Google. It would be great to see a significant increase in both the cash and the equity component of the offer, as well as a meaningful signing bonus.

Can you please let me know what’s possible? I’d appreciate it very much.

### What to Say 6 - The Ladder Fifth Email

The main component of the offer I’d like to focus on is that Google has offered me more than double the equity of Stripe’s current offer. Please let me know what you can do. Thank you again for your help!

### What to Say 7 - The Ladder Sixth Email

Thank you so much for your offer and for all your help with this process so far. I’m excited about this opportunity, but I have several very strong offers in hand, including one from Stripe with a significantly higher TC. It would be great to see a significant increase in both the cash and the equity component of the offer, as well as a meaningful signing bonus. Can you please let me know what’s possible? I’d appreciate it very much.

### What to Say 8 - The Ladder Seventh Email

Of course, happy to share. Stripe has offered me a $225k base with a $30k signing bonus. The equity component of the offer is comparable. I also have an offer from Bloomberg LP that includes a $50k signing bonus. And I have offers from several startups that include a $20k signing bonus and over $500k in equity.

### What to Say 9 - The Ladder Final Email

Thank you for that increase. I really appreciate it. At the moment, Google has offered me $480k in equity. That said, Stripe is my first choice, and I’m ready to sign immediately if we can increase either the equity component or the cash component.

### What to Say 10 - Closing Out

Thank you for all your help throughout this process. I’ve been thinking long and hard about what to do. It hasn’t been an easy decision, but I’m very strongly leaning toward accepting an offer from {Company}. They’ve made me a very strong offer that looks like this: {Share details}

I promised you that I would discuss with you any offers before accepting them, so I’d like to keep my word.

Please let me know if you’d like to chat. And regardless of outcome, thank you again.
