# Part 4 - Offers and negotiation

- Offers usually consist of four components: base salary, equity, signing bonus, and performance bonus
- All of this together is the TC, Total Compensation

## Chapter 10: Components of the offer

### Base salary

- One of the hardest parts to negotiate
- Increases being rarely more than 10-20%
- Studies have shown that raises add up to much less cash than switching jobs every few years

### Equity

- Equity most commonly comes as either stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs)
