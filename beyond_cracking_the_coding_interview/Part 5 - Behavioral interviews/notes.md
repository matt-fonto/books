# Part 5 - Behavioral Interviews

## Chapter 15 - When and how they matter

- The bar is rising for behavioral interviews
- They are used for leveling
  - In tough hiring climates, they can make the difference

### What goes wrong

1. Not using START method
2. Insufficient detail
3. Unprepared / too long answer
4. Lack of conciseness
5. Not answering interviewer's questions
6. Not articulating lessons learned
7. Not showing personal responsibility, humility, empathy

## Chapter 16 - What to say

"Tell me about a challenging project you have tackled"

- This should be on the tip of your tongue

If you don't know the answer to the question above:

1. You say something, but had more challenging situations but didn't think of them.
   This is fault in **preparation**
2. You thought of these other challenges, but didn't select the most relevant one. T
   This is fault in **selecting** and possibly **leveling**
3. You picked a great challenge, but failed to send a compelling message about what was truly important
   This is fault in **signal**
4. You said the right stuff, but the story was disorganized
   This is fault in **communication**

### Signal

- Even though you might answer the question, it can feel flat, without storytelling
- The thing is, the mission isn't necessarily to describe (technically the situation), but to understand "how smart/creative/persistent/problem-solver" you are by walking through the challenge

#### What is signal?

- It's not WHAT happened, but WHO you are
- What does this story should about you?
- Your answers should demonstrate something about you. At the end of each story, they should be felling:
  > "wow, he is a [something good] kind of person"

#### Matching questions to signals

- In open-ended questions, thye are typically looking for a (set of) signal(s)
- Which signals are they trying to identify in the following questions?

1. Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with a difficult team member. How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?

- empathy, collaboration, problem-solving, communication, conflict management, and ability to tailor communication or approach

2. Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a decision made by your manager or team. How did you handle the situation?

- team-player, problem-solving, communication, listening-skills, analytical thinking, emotional intelligence

Tell me about a time when you...

3. ...were working on a project that was behind schedule

- prioritization, organization, capacity to deliver, time management

4. ...made a mistake

- humbleness, ability to admit your mistakes, learning with experience, modesty, self-awareness, maturity

5. ...had to balance the needs of multiple stakeholders

- communication, prioritization, capacity to deliver

6. ...influenced an individual or team

- leadership, problem-solving, communication, capacity to adjust communiation and approach

7. ...identified a performance issue in code

- observation, analytical thinking, problem-solving, technical knowledge

#### Signal in open-ended questions

Good signals to hit:

1. Being smart / creative
2. Being persistent
3. Being technically knowledgeable
4. Can lead / has accomplished things at the level of this role

Every company wants an engineer who...

- is smart
- works hard
- knows a lot
- can lead / work at the appropriate level

### Picking the right projects

- They want to know your skills at:
  - the technical level
  - interpersonal level

#### What makes a good project?

1. Recency and familiarity
   - Recently enough and at enough depth
2. Large contribution
3. Part of a team
   - At more senior levels, this morphs into working well with several other teams or leading several teams
4. Difficult, open-ended task
   - Can you thrive in ambiguous circumstances?
   - The more uncertainty, the better, as long as you can describe how you tamed the chaos
5. Successes and failures
   - Failures: mention what you learned and how you made it right
6. Signal sending stories
   - What attributes does this story tell about you?
   - Often related to the company's values
   - Look up the company's values and identify stories that match them
7. Appropriate scope for the level you're targeting
   - Show them you're already doing the job
   - Thinking at the level of the role you're applying for
8. High visibility, if possible
   - Even though this is important, it shouldn't come at the cost of the other aspects
   - Meaning, if you played a obscure role at some huge project, it's not as important as a meaningful role in something smaller

> Anything, just ask: "I have a project in mind that demonstrates X and another that demonstrates Y. Which one would you rather hear about?"

- If you're not sure about what your interviewer is looking for, just ask
- If you've shown ownership and large contribution (was given minimal direction and didn't have many people to ask), make sure you mention this out
