Complexity Template

Time Complexity: O(...), where

n = ...

m = ... (if second input)

r, c = ... (if matrix/grid)

Space Complexity: O(...), where

variables defined as above.

Example 1:

Time: O(n), where n is the length of the string s.
Space: O(1).

Example 2:

Time: O(n1 + n2), where n1 is the length of s1 and n2 is the length of s2.
Space: O(n1).

Example 3 (matrix):

Time: O(r \* c), where r is the number of rows and c the number of columns.
Space: O(1).
