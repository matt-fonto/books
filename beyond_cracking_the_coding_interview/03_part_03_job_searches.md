# Part 3 - Job searches, from start to finish

## Chapter 6 - Resumes

- Recruiters don't spend too long reviewing your resume
- Optmize, but don't overoptimize it

### What recruiters look at

They are most likely to contact you if:

- you look good on paper (top-tier companies/schools)
- you belong to a group that's underrepresented in tech
- to some extent, if you have niche skills

---

- Recruiters do look at resumes, spending around 30 seconds reviewing them
- They aren't reading the details

--

### Adequate resume

- Make it easy to skim

1. Use a templae
2. Keep it to one or two pages
3. Write up your experience. Clear, concise bullets
4. Add your skills, education, and other sections
5. Proofread

- Usually 1 page is better than 2

  - It allows important stuff to jump out

- What are the top few things that would make a recruiter say "Yes, I want to interview you"

  - Design your resume around those items
  - It should in 30-seconds be easily spotted why

- Clear, concise bulltets

  - Where possible, use metrics
  - Bullets: 1-2 lines

- If you have a good GPA, why not put it?

### Skills

- List languages in proficiency order
- Drop a language if neither of the following is true
  - Worked with it in depth in the last 3 years
  - Can code a typical interview question with it, with only minor syntax errors

### Projects

- At most 3

## Chapter 7 - Getting in the door

- Effective recruiting channels, ranked from most to least effective

  - Warm referrals
  - In-house recruiters contact you
  - Apply online
  - Cold outreach to hiring managers: controllable and effective

- Ineffective recruiting channels
  - Cold outreach to recruiters
  - Cold referrals
  - Agency recruiters contact you

### In your control and useful

- Cold outreach to hiring managers (done right)
- Apply online
  - It's predictable, but not the most effective
- Cold outreach to hiring managers

- Cold outreach to recruiters doesn't work
- Recruiters will play it safe, they can't have a too risky candidate
- The recruiting system is wired to reward (them), for the tip of the tunnel, not how many are hired

### What a brand candidate looks like to recruiters

- Senior engineer
- Went to a top school
- Worked at a top company

### Reach out to hiring managers instead

- Hiring managers are judged on how quickly and effectively they're able to build stuff and are incentivized to grow headcount
- At smaller companies, also target VP and directors

### Recommended practical approach

- Teach your job search as a sales funnel
- Do the reps, brute force it

- Buy a month or two of LinkedIn sales navigator
- Get an account with an email discovery tool like RocketReach
- Get Streak, which lets dynamic typing for Gmail

  - Create a template email, with variables

#### Steps

1. Figure out which companies you're interested in

- Dev tools
- Open source
- Engineers you follow

2. Create target list

- Once you have the list, find hiring managers at those companies (founders, directors, VPs)
- Once the list is done, add them to a spreadsheet and something that can connect you

> If you don't come from a traditional background, look for startups, especially ones where the founder also doesn't have a traditional background

- Once the list of LinkedIn URLs is done, use a tool like RocketReach to look up their emails

  - Why not linkedin? Managers don't usually spend much time on LinkedIn, differently from recruiters
  - However, they spend a good amount of time on their email
  - Contact them through their work email address, preferably. But it's also fine personal.

- Outreach emails aren't a job application

  - Connect with a human being. Don't be a weirdo
  - Not super focused on a specific position or team

- Succint, personalized emails
  - Personalized + short
  - Don't open the email with how you found them
  - Be informal
  - Don't get their gender wrong
  - Write something that's personal. If you haven't invested the time, why should they?
  - No buzzword soup
  - Include a link to LinkedIn or personal website
    - Don't include your CV though, it's presemptuous
  - Make a no-brainer why you are the one
    1. Common ground
    - Referece something they care about, then show how you can contribute to it
    - Reference a project they worked on
      - Reference some work you've done
      - Ask a thoughtful question about theirs
    - Reference a controversial pov that they hold and affirm it in an authentic way
    - In the absence of something technical, it's okay to reference something non-technical
    2. Proof that you're worth the time
    - Accomplishments: what have you built or created?
      - What have you done that it's unique?
    - Social proof
    3. Strong CTA
    - Extend a job interview
    - Start a conversation

### Cold outreach templates

- These emails are much more effective than throwing your resume into the black hole of online portals

[see cold_outreach.md on templates]

## Chapter 8 - Mechanics of the interview process

- Ask about the interview process
  - Topics
  - Format
  - What to expect
  - How you'll be evaluated

### Steps

#### 1. Source/apply (candiate review)

- Passthrough rate around 10%

#### 2. Recruiter call

- Pass rate 75%
- Ask the recruiter before the call, the specific requirements the role has
  - Don't assume job descriptions are accurate
  - Some matter, some don't. They are at most a laundry list of requirements
- What are the non-negotiables for this role?

  - Tell them you've read the job description, but just want to be sure

- Questions to ask them

```
[If it's clear what the non-negotiables are]
I've taken a close look at the job description, and I'm very excited for our call.


[If it's not clear]
- From what I can tell from the job description, the non-negotiable requirements are [insert bullet list here]. I just wanted to confirm that those are indeed correct

Ahead of the call, would you mind sharing the non-negotiable requirements for this position?

I want to make sure I'm prepared to speak to how I meet those requirements and to make the best use of our time together
```

- Hiring managers want somebody that's smart and gets shit done
- If you don't have some requirements... the best thing is that you can do is to show you possess many of the same traits as people who do

##### Mistake to avoid

- Don't reveal your compensation...
  - history
  - expectation
- Don't reveal where else you're interviewing and where you're in the process

##### Questions to ask

- What are the steps of the rest of the process?
- How long does it take to get through the process, on average?
- What to expect during the technical phone screen
  - Types of questions: DSA or practical?
  - Tooling
- Components of the onsite
- What are the reasons most candidates fail the tehnical and the onsite?
- Is there something I should've asked, but missed?

#### 3. Technical interview

- 25% of candidates pass through this
- The objective is just to cut people who aren't likely to pass the onsite
- Does asking questions at the end matter?

  - 50% of interviews don't care
  - 25% expect you to ask somethign
  - 25% want to see curiosity

- Therefore, prepare some basic questions about the company, role, team, or technology
