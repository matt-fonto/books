# Anatomy of a coding interview

0. Opening chat
1. Understand the problem
   - Read the statement (twice)
   - Work through examples out loud
   - Ask clarifying questions
     - Edge cases
     - Input/output format
     - Scale constraints
2. Design the algorithm
   - Minimially sketch naive solution
   - Identify upper & lower bounds
   - Look for triggers
   - Employ boosters
     - Booster: Brute force optmimization
     - Help: Hunt for properties
     - Developers: Decrease the difficulty
     - Crack: Cycle through the catalog
     - Algorithms: Articulate your blocker
3. Explain the solution
   - Examples
   - Indented English
   - Name & justify
4. Get buy-in
   - The magic question
5. Code the solution
   - Main logic
   - Helper functions
   - Stop if you get lost
6. Verify the solution
   - Top-to-bottom pass
   - Tricky expressions
   - Run through with tiny input
   - Check edge cases
   - Verify analysis
7. Closing chat & questions
